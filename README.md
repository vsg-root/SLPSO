## About SL-PSO

The Social Learning Particle Swarm Optimization is a population-based optimization algorithm inspired by the behavior of a swarm of particles. It leverages social interactions to enhance exploration of the search space and convergence to optimal solutions in scalable optimization problems.

## Installation

To get started with SLPso, you can install it via pip:

```bash
pip install slpso
```
